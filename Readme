Grid_and_Orca:
1.Run grid.in to generate 1296 configurations of YOPRO in vacuum.
2.Run excited.cpp to generate inputs of S1 for Orca.
3.Run exec_mul.sh to generate job submission script.
4.Run submit.sh to run all jobs

Calculate quantum single point energy:
5.Run get_orca_energy.cpp to get quantum single energy value of each configuration and write single_point.txt.

Calculated classical potential energy with the fitted diherdals excluded:
6.Create YOPRO.frcmod to turn off the fitted dihedral FCs.
7.Run tleap.in to get .top of YOPRO with charges fitted in water.
8.Create min.sh using conf${a}.crd from the previous step 1 to generate min_${a}.in and run one step minimization
9.Run exec_min.qsub to run min.sh.
10. Run get_amber_energy.cpp to get classical potential energy with the fitted diherdals excluded from min_*.out.

Caculated pure tortional contribution of the fitted diherdals:
11. Run substract.cpp to get pure tortional contribution of the fitted diherdals.
